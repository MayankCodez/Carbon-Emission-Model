# Carbon-Emission-Model
Problem Statement:
-> Industries underreport emissions
-> AQI levels often donâ€™t match reported data
-> No real-time, scalable system for local emission verification

Our solution is technically viable using AI models and AQI datasets, while being cost-effective with open data and open-source tools. It is operationally feasible through a user-friendly web portal, community reporting, and easy government integration.
